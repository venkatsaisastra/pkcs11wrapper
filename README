IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper for Java, Version 1.3
=============================================

The PKCS#11 API is specified in the ANSI-C programming 
language. This library maps the complete PKCS#11 API to 
an equivalent Java API in a straight forward style. 
This allows to access PKCS#11 modules from Java.

It does not contain a JCA/JCE provider implementation. 
This means that the PKCS#11 Wrapper alone is not 
compatible with the Java cryptographic APIs like JCA 
and JCE.
There is a different product which provides this - the 
IAIK PKCS#11 Provider. 

The current version of this package is available from

http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/download/
